# openrc-migrator
OpenRC migrator script for Arch Linux and derivatives. Licenced under GNU GPLv3

This script is intended to be used to migrate _after_ the installation of the base systemd-powered system.

The amount of testing that has been done is rather poor, though the individual parts of the script had been confirmed to work.

The script is most likely to stay rather stale and be subjected to very few changes, though the contributions are welcome.
